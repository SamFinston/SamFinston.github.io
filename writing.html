                Hello hello! I'm a Boston-based writer who's been penning poetry since 2016. As you'll see in my portfolio 
                below, I tend toward shorter form pieces and experiment in all directions. I especially love incorporating
                my other hobbies— such as art and code— into my work to make hybrid projects that I distribute in the wild and on the web.
                My writing isn't limited to poems either, as I have experience in journalism and game writing as well. Shoot me an email if
                you're interested in collaborating, publishing, or just want to say hi!

                In April 2025 my poem "Property Value" was selected by former Boston Poet Laureate Porsha Olayiwola to be displayed inside
                City Hall. On April 25th I was invited to give a reading at the Speaker's Corner outside the building alongside the other 
                selected poets and current laureate Emmanuel Oppong-Yeboah. This year's theme was "experimental," so I submitted a piece
                that made use of footnotes, each referring to the address of a building, business, or landmark that no longer remains in
                Greater Boston. You can currently find my poem on display by the east elevator on the ninth floor, where it hangs in good 
                company alongside an exhibit of historic maps of the city.

                "nowadaysical" is an upcoming chapbook compiling some of the work I'm most proud of spanning the years immediately before
                and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in the US. The poems weave a loose personal chronicle of the four seasons in the 
                wake of the pandemic and of starting a new chapter in life. The manuscript is complete and has already been submitted 
                to several small presses, pending acceptance for publication. If you are interested in helping to get "nowadaysical"

                    As part of a digital creative writing workshop with poet Danielle Pafunda, I wrote a cycle of poems in the
                    form of interactive web pages. The project explores what it means to be a "functioning" person, with each piece taking
                    advantage of a different aspect of the browser. In the same workshop, I created a page that allows users to randomize some of the
                    key words in William Carlos Williams's "This is Just to Say," using the RiTaJS API. Both of these projects were
                    created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
